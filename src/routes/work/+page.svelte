	<h2>Work Experience</h2>
	<div>
		<h3>Flexport</h3>
		<p>
			My most recent experience is my <strong>Full Stack Software Engineer</strong> internship at Flexport.
			There I owned a support form integration feature end-to-end, heavily refactoring the feature in
			one application and adding an implementation in another, allowing better user experience and reduced
			complexity when modifying the support form. This allowed me to work as a full-stack developer in
			a scrum team on my own project and general tasks, developing with technologies such as React.js,
			Ruby on Rails, NextJS, Flow, and GraphQL.

		<h3>Google Font Box</h3>
		<p>
			My most recent project is Google Font Box! Google Font Box is a simple tool to help developers
			develop font and color schemes for their next project, as users can make custom font schemes
			from Google Fonts and choose their own colors as well.
